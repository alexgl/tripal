/**
 * Generates JSON used for generating a Google chart of count data associated
 * with a controlled vocabulary.  An example would be features assigned to
 * Gene Ontology terms.  
 * To generate a chart, the progammer must first create a materialized view that
 * will generate count data for a given controlled vocabulary.  For example, the Tripal
 * Analysis GO creates a materialized view for counting Gene Ontology assignments
 * to features.  This view is created on install of the module and is named
 * 'go_count_analysis'.
 *
 * Next, an HTML 'div' box must be added to the desired page
 * with a class name of 'tripal_cv_chart', and an id of the following format:
 *
 *  tripal_[module_name]_cv_chart_[unique id]
 *
 * where [module_name] is the name of the tripal module (e.g. tripal_analyisis_go)
 * and [unique id] is some unique identifier that the contolling module 
 * recognizes. This string is the $chart_id variable passed as the first argument
 * to the function.  For example, the Tripal GO Analysis module generates 
 * chart ids of the form:
 * 
 *  tripal_analysis_go_cv_chart_10_2_bp
 * 
 * In this case the module that will manage this chart is identified as 'tripal_analysis_go' and within
 * the [unique id] portion contains the
 * organism_id (e.g. 10), analysis_id (e.g. 2) and chart type (bp = biological process). 
 *
 * Second, the programmer must then define a hook in the controlling module for setting
 * some options used to build the chart.  The hook has the form:  hook_cv_chart($chart_id).
 * This hook should accept the full $chart_id as the single parameter.  For the Tripal
 * Analysis GO module the hook is named:  tripal_analysis_go_cv_chart.  
 *
 * The array returned by this hook must have the following fields:  
 *  - count_mview
 *      the name of the materialized view that contains the count data
 *      this materialized view must have at least two columns, one with the cvterm_id
 *      for each term and a second column containing the counts
 *  - cvterm_id_column
 *      the column name in the materialized view that contains
 *      the cvterm_ids
 *  - count_column
 *      the column name in the materialized view that contains the
 *      counts
 *  - filter
 *      an SQL compatible WHERE clause string (whithout the word 'WHERE')
 *      that can be used for filtering the records in the materialized view.
 *  - title
 *      the title for the chart
 *  - type
 *      the type of chart to create (see Google Charts documenation). Leave
 *      blank for a pie chart.
 *  - size 
 *      the dimensions of the chart in pixels (see Google Charts documenations 
 *      for exact size limitations).
 *
 * Example from the tripal_analysis_go module:
 * @code
 *  function tripal_analysis_go_cv_chart($chart_id){
 *  
 *    // The CV module will create the JSON array necessary for buillding a
 *    // pie chart using jgChart and Google Charts.  We have to pass to it
 *    // a table that contains count information, tell it which column 
 *    // contains the cvterm_id and provide a filter for getting the
 *    // results we want from the table.
 *    $organism_id = preg_replace("/^tripal_analysis_go_cv_chart_(\d+)-(\d+)_(bp|cc|mf)$/","$1",$chart_id);
 *    $analysis_id = preg_replace("/^tripal_analysis_go_cv_chart_(\d+)-(\d+)_(bp|cc|mf)$/","$2",$chart_id);
 *    $type        = preg_replace("/^tripal_analysis_go_cv_chart_(\d+)-(\d+)_(bp|cc|mf)$/","$3",$chart_id);
 *  
 *    $sql = "SELECT * FROM {Analysis} WHERE analysis_id = %d";
 *    $previous_db = tripal_db_set_active('chado');  // use chado database
 *    $analysis = db_fetch_object(db_query($sql,$analysis_id));
 *    tripal_db_set_active($previous_db);  // now use drupal database
